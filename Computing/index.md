# Computing

Why relevant:

* ubiquity
* it is cool to know it

* [Skills](./skills.md)
* [Tasks](./tasks.md)

## Architecture

Computers have:

* CPUs with multiple cores, executing multiple threads
* RAM
* Persistent storage

Examples of computers: your laptop, your phone, your watch, climate controller,
smart lock.

## Operating System

What differentiates a true computer and a controller.
We focus on the former unless specified otherwise.

Example OSs:

* [OS/360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors)
* [Windows 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11)
* [MacOS 14 Sonoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Sonoma)
* [Ubuntu 24.04 LTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#2404)

(Engineering) Mind-share leader: Linux family of OSes.

Trends:

* commoditization
* immutability

## GUI Environment/Shell

Establish terminology:

* cursor vs caret
* icon
* window
* title bar
* scrollbar
* status bar
* menubar
* pull down menu
* Popup menu
* dialog box
* pop up

Widgets/controls:

* check box
* radio box
* group box
* tabbed dialog
* button
* tooltip

The above terminology is fully applicable to both native and web applications.

More in depth:
[Sus Lundgren. What makes a GUI good?](https://studylib.net/doc/5460687/).
Check-up: give example how cursor is used to communicate pliancy.

There exist(ed) OSes without GUI:

* [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) - old enough to be before GUI
* [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs) - new but still lacks GUI to
preserve resources.
* [Amazon Bottlerocket](https://aws.amazon.com/bottlerocket/)

We will not be talking about GUI anymore.

## Want to look cool? Use keyboard!

* [Mac keyboard shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236)
* [Windows keyboard shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-keyboard-shortcuts-3d444b08-3a00-abd6-67da-ecfc07e86b98)

## Processes

Process is not a window.

Each [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)) has:

* an ID
* state
* command line
* environment
* threads
* parent, and (maybe) children

Benefits:

* compartmentalization
* (mutual) protection

## File System

File systems:

* [ntfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS)

## Command Line, Shell and Text Processing

wiki:

* [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
* [command line interpreters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_command-line_interpreters)

[zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) made to all the operating systems!
