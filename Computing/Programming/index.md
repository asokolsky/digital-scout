# Programming

Here are some [programming paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) and some examples.


## Imperative Programming

[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming)

Key concepts:

* [procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming)
* [iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration)
* [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)

How to describe a procedure/function:

* input arguments
* what is returned
* exceptions?
* [side-effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)), change of global state

## Object-Oriented Programming

[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

Key concepts:

* class, including pure abstract
* instance of the class
* instance variables - data
* (virtual) methods - behavior
* inheritance
* encapsulation
* polymorphism

## Functional Programming

[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

Key concepts:

* recursion, including tail recursion
* [closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming))

Why bother: absence of side-effects makes it the best choice for parallel programming.
