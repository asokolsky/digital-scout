## Practical Problems

### Dusty rug

The rug is dusty.  Suggest a few ways to get rid of the dust.  Explain why it works.

### Pull the car out

The car is stuck in a mud.  The force required to pull the car out is much larger than your weight.  All you have is:

* a rigid rope, e.g. a steel cable,
* an X-shaped tire wrench and
* a tree nearby

Suggest a few ways to pull the car out of the mud.  Why does it work?

### Shouting against the wind

Why shouting against the wind does not work?  Why shouting into the wind does not work well either?

### Testing tank integrity

Can this tank hold a certain pressure?  You have a manometer and a pump which can pump either air of water into the tank.  Which approach is safer?  Why?

### Rubber band marks

Assuming you wear clothing around your waist with en elastic rubber band.  Where does it exert a highest pressure leaving the marks?  You can assume that the rubber band is stretched evenly.

### Wound bandage

Relies on understanding gained from the 'Rubber band marks' problem.

You need to bandage a wound exerting disproportionally high pressure on one point.  How would you do it?  You have a few rolls of cotton bandage.

### Power Delivery

Apple power delivery standard (used to charge or power e.g. a laptop via a USB-C cable) increases the voltage supplied to the connected device.  What's the benefit in increasing the voltage?  Why can't we use standard USB 5V to charge laptop battery or power laptop?

## Even More Practical Problems (Know Your Formulas)

### Collision of two balls

A ball of mass `m`, travelling at speed `v`, hits on-center a resting ball of mass `M`.  How will the balls move after the collision?  Which assumptions did you make?

Expore boundary cases.  "physical sense"?
