### Options

Not for the beginners!

* Call options give the holder the right – but not the obligation – to buy something at a specific price for a specific time period.
* Put options give the holder the right – but not the obligation – to sell something at a specific price for a specific time period.

Here is a couple of usage scenarios.

#### To Hedge a Portfolio

Use options to protect against losses in stocks you own, much like buying insurance for your investments.

* Buying put options can limit your downside risk on a stock you own.

* For short sellers, call options can limit losses if the stock price moves against their position.


#### To generate income

Sell call options on stocks you already own (a strategy called a "covered call") to collect premium income.

* This can be a way to generate extra income from your existing holdings, with the risk that your potential profit is limited if the stock price rises significantly above the strike price.

* Sell put options on stocks you are willing to own at a lower price to collect premium income.
