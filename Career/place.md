# What is Your Place/Distribution

You will be employed:
* in a specific role or function, e.g. Marketing or Engineering or Sales,
* by a company in a specific industry, e.g Semiconductors or Financial Services or SAAS or Healthcare, Defense,
* by a company in a specific phase of the lifecycle, e.g. start-up or public company.

My observations in an arbitrary order:
* Switching both role and industry in one move is hard.  Try to switch one at a time.  E.g. if you are an engineer in a semiconductor company but want to do marketing for a healthcare company - find an engineering job in a healthcare company first and next switch the role within the same industry.
* Established industry leader looks good on the resume of the junior professional - it indicates that the professional is likely to know how things are supposed to be done;
* Startup experience has its own benefits: "ability to work under pressure, multitask", etc;
* industry experience (e.g. Semiconductor, SaaS) can have lasting benefits.  I was hired by Samsung because I had experience with AMAT, as one of the managerial types told me.  It made no sense to me, but, hey, it worked.

Recommendations:

* majority of the start-ups fail, rendering stock options irrelevant;
* always use referrals, when available, see HOWTO below. If not available, use LinkedIn to connect to the friend of a friend and then use referral;
* apply for the jobs with public companies directly, but see the above;
* a 3rd party recruiter may work if you look for job with start-ups.

## HOWTO Apply via Referral

Usually the referrer gets paid if the referred is hired.  If your application is already in the company database, the referrer is NOT paid.  This will significantly reduce their motivation to help you.  Therefore the sequence of the steps is important:

* identify the position with the company where you have connection(s), get the requisitionID;
* contact your connection, express the interest in the opening, provide the requisitionID and your resume;
* ask your connection to file your resume as a referral to the specific requisitionID;
* for the extra credit, ask your connection to contact the hiring manager and put a good word for you.

Benefits:
* you will stand out;
* your contact may help you in identifying the hiring manager;
* your contact may help you in getting feedback if your application is rejected;
* your contact now has a vested interest in your success.

Lessons to learn:
* you do NOT want for your resume to be filed with very company under the sun - this will take away the power of the referral;
* stay in control of your resume - every time you talk to any recruiter make sure to say: "please make sure to NOT submit my resume to any position without my prior approval".
