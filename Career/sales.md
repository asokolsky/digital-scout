# Selling Your Professional Persona

As a sales person (of your professional persona) you should project energetic and competent demeanor.

## Interviewing

See [soft skills](../Collaboration/soft-skills.md) for importance of:

* being on time,
* body language,
* what being prepared means in the age of zoom calls.

Be ready:

* to make your [pitch](promotion.md);
* to answer [questions](interview-questions.md);
* to [take notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw3SkhB4dMk)

What works for me to keep context while interviewing:
* use a single google doc per engagement
* the first tab is always position description.  Re-read it before every interview, pay attention to the terms used, try to use these in your answers.
* second tab is interaction (usually e-mail) with the recruiter.
* add new tab for every new interview.
* record the date, name of the interviewer and a link to their LinkdIn profile.
* always have your questions ready in advance, ideally fine-tuned to the interviewer, e.g. "_Name_, as somebody who has been with the company for _4_ years, how did the tech stack changed?"


## Follow-up

It is [important to follow-up](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/how-to-follow-up-after-an-interview).  What works for me:
* Review and fix your notes, ASAP, while you still remember the details.
* Write down the questions you were asked, especially if you think you under-performed in your answer.  Research the best answer and write it down.
* write a thank you note to the recruiter thanking the team for interviewing you.
