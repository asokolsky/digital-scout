# Promotion

Promotion here is an umbrella term for all the activities you undertake to communicate the value of the product, your professional persona.

The goal of the promotion is to project a cohesive image, easily digestible by the target audience.

In the order of the effort required to digest your pitch:

## Elevator Pitch

Your [elevator pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch) answers question  "Who are you?".

You should:
* be able to spit it out without thinking much;
* adjust it according to the audience;
* deliver the answer in an engaging manner.

## Resume

You resume:

* is a marketing document, not a [Curriculum Vitae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae);
* when adding anything to it, ask yourself: how does this incrementally improve my communicated product value proposition?
* Length: 1 page for anybody with <2 years of experience, <=2 pages otherwise;
* I prefer use of highly technical terms.  I can see how this may not work for everyone;
* section Summary/Profile articulates the core of your professional persona;
* For US: no date of birth, no dates for degrees/education (unless you are still in school), no photos, no family status;

## LinkedIn

You need to be:
* present on LinkedIn;
* be a member in the relevant LinkedIn groups;
* have posts and, ideally, LinkedIn articles;
* make some (insightful) comments to the posts of the others.

## GitHub

If you are an engineering type (no matter which) or work for a high-tech company, you need to be:
* present on GitHub;
* have repos. Cloning repos alone is not enough;
* have a GitHub Pages site.

For software engineers, you also need:

* have issues submitted into the repos you do not own;
* have some PRs merged into the repos you do not own.
