# What is Your Price?

Here are few ways to get your bearings:

* https://motionrecruitment.com/it-salary
* ask around - you will be surprised how much people are willing to share if you ask.

[Anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern):
> I am being paid $X but I am worth much more than that, at least $Y, because blah, blah.

Why not to say that: you made your choice and accepted compensation of $X.  Hence you established your going market rate.  Fair or not, the market has spoken.

What to do about it: if you feel the effort of finding a new job justifies potential gain in compensation - go for it.  Nothing personal.  Your employer is not your family.  They will replace you faster than you think.

## Employee's Full Compensation Package

As an employee, your compensation package may (theoretically) include:
* sign-on bonus
* salary
* yearly bonus
* [equity compensation](https://www.parkworth.com/equity-compensation):
    * non-qualified stock options ([NQSOs](https://www.parkworth.com/blogs/non-qualified-stock-options-basic-features-and-taxation)),
    * incentive stock options ([ISOs](https://www.parkworth.com/blogs/2017/8/22/incentive-stock-options-and-alternative-minimum-tax)),
    * [restricted stock units](https://www.parkworth.com/blogs/an-introduction-to-restricted-stock-and-rsus) ([RSUs](https://www.parkworth.com/blogs/rsus-101a-quick-refresher))
    * employee stock purchase plan ([ESPP](https://www.parkworth.com/blogs/why-you-should-take-advantage-of-your-companys-employee-stock-purchase-plan))
* healthcare benefits
* [retirement account](https://www.parkworth.com/blogs/2017/8/29/401k-plan-basicspart-i-tax-advantages-and-rules-to-remember/), [401(k)](https://www.parkworth.com/blogs/2017/8/29/401k-plan-basicspart-ii-contributions-investment-options-and-recommendations), ideally with employer-matching contribution
* other fringe benefits
* support for working from home

The above is a full list and, in my experience, the particular package never includes all these items.

## Communicating your Price

Common recommendations:
* stick to ranges;
* the longer you can postpone this discussion the better;
* the more junior you are, the less negotiation power you hold, but you should not be giving up.
