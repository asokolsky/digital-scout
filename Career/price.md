# What is Your Price?

Here are few ways to get your bearings:

* https://motionrecruitment.com/it-salary
* ask around - you will be surprised how much people are willing to share if you ask.

[Anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern):
> I am being paid $X but I am worth much more than that, at least $Y, because blah, blah.

Why not to say that: you made your choice and accepted compensation of $X.  Hence you established your going market rate.  Fair or not, the market has spoken.

What to do about it: if you feel the effort of finding a new job justifies potential gain in compensation - go for it.  Nothing personal.  Your employer is not your family.  They will replace you faster than you think.

## Full Compensation Package

Your compensation package may include:
* sign-on bonus
* salary
* yearly bonus
* stock options, a.k.a ISU/RSU/etc
* healthcare benefits
* matching contribution to your retirement account
* other fringe benefits
* support for working from home

## Communicating your Price

Common recommendations:
* stick to ranges;
* the longer you can postpone this discussion the better;
* the more junior you are, the less negotiation power you hold, but you should not be giving up.
