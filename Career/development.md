# Product (Your Career) Development

Your product (professional persona) features are a combination of your  [Soft](../Collaboration/soft-skills.md) and Hard skills.

## Hard Skills

In a dynamic competitive environment professional certifications or even courses can play a major role.

If you are an engineering type (no matter which) or work for a high-tech company, you (at least) should be able to:

* author a markdown doc
* recognize and edit JSON and YAML
* use git CLI, including:
    - create branch
    - make a commit
    - push to / pull from origin
    - extra credit for understanding git commit hook
* use command line, including
    - move cursor by word
    - incremental forward/backward in the command history
    - use clipboard keyboard accelerators
* use vi:
    - being able to save file or abandon it and to quit
    - use search
* have opinion on IDE and be able to justify it
* use LLM, have tips on increased efficiency.  My tip: use structured input, e.g. json or md.

## Professional Development

What worked for me:

* following industry publications/blogs/youtube channels.
* reviewing job posts from industry leaders - I use LinkedIn.
* informational [interviews](sales.md) - approach these as if they are real, be prepared.
