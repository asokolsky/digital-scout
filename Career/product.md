# What is Your Product?

Your professional persona is described like this:

* I am _role_ in _industry_

where _role_ can be stated using industry jargon and _industry_ it your [potential employer](place.md)

Here is what worked and did not work for me:

* Software engineer - this is how I started my career and what I spent most of my life doing.  It worked.  Overtime transitioned to DevOps engineering.
* Engineering Manager - it worked for a while, >10 years.  No longer.
* Technical Product Manager - I failed miserably on this.  One feedback I got from a major employer was that my accent was too distracting.  But then, again, this was during a major market downturn.

You should be able to clearly communicate your professional identity as an [elevator pitch](promotion.md).

Your professional persona will need to [change](development.md).  You lack focus at first.  As you mature, make sure to include/use enough of buzzwords to communicate your staying in touch with the industry.  Consider having multiple professional personas at a time.
