# Career, Job Search

Majority of millionaires in US are professionals who work their jobs and consistently save for retirement.  Not entrepreneurs or trust fund babies.  Their lifetime taxes are also disproportionately high.

I am of analytical type and do not do 'holistic' anything.  Hence my approach is to split a problem into smaller pieces and then attack one problem aspect at a time.

When you build your career you wear multiple hats:

* you are the [product](product.md) manager - you define the product features - your professional persona;
* you are responsible for product [development](development.md) - your skills - both soft and technical;
* you are the sales person - you [sell](sales.md) your professional persona to the prospective employers.

This is overwhelming.  Until you take the first stab.  And you crash and burn.  And then you iterate. Rinse and repeat, while learning and adjusting your product positioning.

The three things above happen no matter whether you think things through or not.  If you do not take charge - life will do it for you.  Then things will happen to you.  Remember, [no decision is still a decision](https://www.higherlogic.com/blog/no-decision-is-still-a-decision-what-does-it-cost-you/).

## Your Product Marketing Mix

Your [Marketing Mix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix) includes:

* [Product](product.md): this is your professional persona;
* [Price](price.md): what's the going rate for professionals of your level;
* [Place/Distribution](price.md): geography, industry, prospective employer type;
* [Promotion](promotion.md): all the activities you undertake to communicate the value of the product.
