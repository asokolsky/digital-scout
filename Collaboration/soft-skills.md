# Soft Skills

From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_skills):

> critical thinking, problem solving, public speaking, professional writing,
teamwork, digital literacy, leadership, professional attitude, work ethic,
career management and intercultural fluency.

Also:

* [active listening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening)
* communication: written, speaking in a meeting
* [persuasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persuasion)

## Body Language

From [body language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_language):

> Some researchers conclude that nonverbal communication accounts for the majority of information transmitted during interpersonal interactions.

Recommended:
* anything and all by [Vanessa Van Edwards](https://www.youtube.com/@Vvanedwards).
* eye contact - strike a balance between maintaining it but not staring;
* moderate body movements including hand gestures.

During online presentation:
* avoid mouse movements unless necessary.

## What to Wear

[Business casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_casual) is a safe choice.  In my opinion jeans are NOT part of the business casual mix.

Increasingly I see a [baseball cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_cap) becoming widely acceptable in the office, including during the interviewing.

## Time Management

[Time management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management) is culturally-specific. For me it means:

* I am on time;
* I am prepared by the time the meeting starts.

Being prepared in the age of zoom calls means:

* my video is ON;
* my mic is ON;
* I am familiar with the agenda and have my questions ready;
* I am ready to [take notes](../Career/note-taking.md).

## Media Savvy

I have to admit: I am judgemental, especially toward professional types like me.  You loose points if:

* your mic is not working by the time the meeting is expected to start;
* your audio is undiscernible because of the room echo and your use of the laptop's onboard speakers and mic;
* you ask 'can you hear me?' - learn how to monitor your outgoing audio;
* your camera shakes when you type;
* your camera lets me see your nose hair.

### Sounding Good

Quality of audio is more important than that of video.  To not loose points, for audio I:

* use a (BT wireless) headset with a boom mic;
* if the battery is discharged I plug the cable and use [the same headset](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODRSN0A) as wired.
* as a backup I always carry Apple AirPods - they take almost no space, hold charge well, provide decent audio;
* as a second backup I always carry wired earbuds;
* control my outgoing audio source (and sometimes) volume using the conferencing software.

### Looking Good

To not loose points, for video I:

* use a thunderbolt hub with my laptop at home with a dedicated (1080p) webcam mounted on my monitor (never use your webcam audio!)
* when I have to use my laptop camera - I try to mount it on a stand at eye level;
* use a dedicated soft (bounced) light to ensure my face is well lit.

You need a headshot for professional media:

* you are the only person in the picture;
* headshot (shoulders up) preferred;
* you face should be the brightest element in the picture, high key background is OK.
