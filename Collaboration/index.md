# Collaboration

Why relevant: ubiquity

Goal:

* deliver repeatable business results

Skills:

* [soft skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_skills), note the origin
* install vscode
* edit markdown file
* use git for version control of the text documents
* static web site generation

## Soft Skills

From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_skills):

> critical thinking, problem solving, public speaking, professional writing,
teamwork, digital literacy, leadership, professional attitude, work ethic,
career management and intercultural fluency.

Also:

* [active listening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening)
* communication: written, speaking in a meeting
* [persuasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persuasion)
* [time management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management)

## Team

Team structure and dynamics, from a
[collective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist_collective) to a
[benevolent dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictatorship).

## Version Control

General problem of
[version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)

## Standalone git Repo

* version tree

## Hosted git Repo as a Collaboration Tool

* [hosting git repo in the cloud](https://asokolsky.github.io/apps/git/hosting.html)
* pull request
* [github action](https://github.com/features/actions)

## Collaboration Workflow

* [bug tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_tracking_system) /
[issue database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system);
* git repository, self-hosted or [hosted in the cloud](https://asokolsky.github.io/apps/git/hosting.html).

The above are used in concert to achieve
[traceability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_traceability):

* direct: Requirements -> Design -> Implementation
* reverse: Implementation -> Design -> Requirements

## Static Website, Collaboration Example

* [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)
* [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/)
* [BitBucket Pages](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud/)

Both use [Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)), one of many
[static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/).
