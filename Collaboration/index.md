# Collaboration

Can we scale up the results by collaborating?

Why relevant: ubiquity.

Success scenarios: engineering disciplines, high tech businesses, teams of script writers for serials.

Failure scenarios: classical and modern literature, art.

Goal: deliver repeatable business results

Skills:

* [soft skills](soft-skills.md)
* install vscode
* edit markdown file
* use git for version control of the text documents
* static web site generation

## Team

Team structure and dynamics, from a [collective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist_collective) to a [benevolent dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictatorship).

## Artifacts and Formats

* binary vs text-based
* presentation vs semantics

Engineering choice: test-based, semantics-oriented.

Benefits - lends itself to better:

* version control
* search

Presentation is controlled via [style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_(desktop_publishing)) [sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_(web_development)).

### Markdown

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a kind of [markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language).

## Version Control

General problem of [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) and [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) as a de-facto standard.

## (Standalone) git Repo

git [repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)) can be visualized as a set of sheets of paper (branches), each sheet of paper holding all the files.

* version tree

## Hosted git Repo as a Collaboration Tool

* [hosting git repo in the cloud](https://asokolsky.github.io/apps/git/hosting.html)
* pull request
* [github action](https://github.com/features/actions)
* [Everyday life of a software engineer](https://asokolsky.github.io/software-engineering/development-cycle.html)

## Collaboration Workflow

* [bug tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_tracking_system) /
[issue database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system);
* git repository, self-hosted or [hosted in the cloud](https://asokolsky.github.io/apps/git/hosting.html).

The above are used in concert to achieve
[traceability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_traceability):

* direct: Requirements -> Design -> Implementation
* reverse: Implementation -> Design -> Requirements

## Static Website, Collaboration Example

[Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)) is one of many [static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/).

* [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)
* [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/)
* [BitBucket Pages](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud/)
